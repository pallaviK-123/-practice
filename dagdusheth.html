            <p>Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a trader and sweet maker settled in Pune. His
                original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune.
                Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. In the later 1800s, they lost
                their only son in a plague epidemic. They were approached by a compassionate sage who advised them to
                build a Ganesha temple in Pune.[6]</p>

            <p>Later, as they did not have any heir, Dagdusheth adopted his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9
                years old at the time of their death. </p>
